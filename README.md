# Slimefreak's Gems

Slimefreak's Gems is a simple Minecraft datapack I made for a small server that alters copper generation and replaces Deepslate Copper Ore to Geodes that can drop new and existing gemstones. Side effect of this datapack is that copper ores will spawn less frequently and deepslate copper ore will not exist.
I do not know if I'll ever update or change this datapack. This was my first attempt at a datapack and if you need something similar as this for your server you can use this as a template. You are allowed to modify and alter the datapack however you want. You can use the textures for whatever you want.
You can redistribute and alter the pack completely. Just give me a credit.
