# Slimefreak's Gems

Slimefreak's Gems is a simple Minecraft datapack I made for a small server that alters copper generation and replaces Deepslate Copper Ore to Geodes that can drop new and existing gemstones. Side effect of this datapack is that copper ores will spawn less frequently and deepslate copper ore will not exist.
I do not know if I'll ever update or change this datapack. This was my first attempt at a datapack and if you need something similar as this for your server you can use this as a template. You are allowed to modify and alter the datapack however you want. You can use the textures for whatever you want.
You can redistribute and alter the pack completely.

# Disclaimer
This datapack does nothing on its own. It can only spawn the ore and use its loot table. The gemstones you get from breaking the geodes currently has no use. This datapack is a template datapack and you're meant to modify it to use it. The pack works on 1.21.3(Tested) and it should(hopefully) work on versions between 1.20.5 and 1.21.3. If it doesn't you can probably fix it using slight modifications. If you don't know how to modify it you can just create an issue and I will fix it for you.

Silk Touch and Fortune does not work on Geodes! This is intentional to make the gemstones rarer.

Geodes will replace Deepslate Copper Ore and will spawn between y level 8 and -60.
When mined, It will either drop an emerald, diamond, amethyst shard or one of the 13 new gemstones.
Their chances of dropping are represented by their **Weight**. The higher the weight is, the higher the chance of the item dropping.

# Questions
You probably have some questions, I will try to answer some of them here.

**Q1: Why use Deepslate Copper Ore? Why not something else? Why not use a custom block?**
I **did try** to use Deepslate Emerald Ore, but I couldn't get the ore to spawn normally because Emerald Ore spawns on the Extreme Hills biome. I tried to use Deepslate Coal Ore but that meant I had to change the spawn rate of coal ore as well. The only remaining option was to use Deepslate Copper Ore because copper rarely spawns beneath the deepslate layer anyway and it is pretty useless. You can also get tons of copper from Trial Chambers. As for the custom blocks, not only they are complex and hard to implement like a beginner like me(this is my first datapack) it also messes up world generation. Especially when you use other datapacks like Terralith and Tectonic.


**Q2: How can I download it?**
Just go to https://github.com/Slimefreakk/SlimefreaksGems/releases and download the latest version.


**Q3: There are 4 seperate files, which one should I download?**
You basically have to download the resource pack for the textures to show up, as for the others:

The **Full** version is basically the combination of CGG and Gems. If you download this version you don't have to do anything else. Just put the file in the datapack folder and use the resource pack and you're good!

**CGG4SFG** is basically the Geode generator as a seperate datapack. If you have issues with world generation just use the **Gems Only** datapack or if you just want to see the ore generation, use this pack.
It only changes the copper ore generation and also disables Deepslate Copper Ore smelting and blasting recipes.

**Gems Only** datapack is pretty self explanatory. It does not have the ore generation and just the ore and the gems.
**DISCLAIMER:** Deepslate Copper Ore is STILL replaced by Geode and it STILL drops gemstones. This pack just doesn't have the world generation stuff.

The order of the packs does **not** matter.
